* Why did I pick dylan?  I can't get anything to work. lots of files, long command names.  tonight we dine in Makefile hell.
* I should really figure out if vscode has support for dylan.  not enjoying the vim life.
* re: dylan, weird separation of code from imports.  "use" things inside library.dylan?  I'm not building a library.  why are there two sets of use there?
  there's no clear signal that I've seen for what needs to be "used" to make symbols accessible.  docs feel like I have to read prose to figure
  it out.
* ok _finally_ landed on a formulation of parsing the input file that worked, after beating my head against with-open-file for hours.  after that it was easy:
    1. figure out how to convert a string to integer.  string-to-integer, duh.
    2. write the doubly nested loop
